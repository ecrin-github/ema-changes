# ema-changes
Identifies the Ids of trials recently updated by the EMA using an XML source file

Also a test project for setting up a Go module. Initiated in GitHub, for cloning to local repository.

So for future reference...
The steps were:

1. Add a new repo in GitHub, adding in the standard ReadMe file, the .git ignore file (with the Go template), and the MIT license.
2. On the local system, open terminal in the parent folder for the new project. For me: D:\OneDrive\Development\Go\Projects
3. In the terminal, type 'git clone https://github.com/scanhamman/ema-changes' (in this case), i.e. the URL of the remote repo.
4. This creates a new folder in the Projects parent reposiutory, called ema-changes. The ReadMe, gitignore and licence files are all copied.
5. In VS, make a change - e.g. add a main.go file (with just 'package main' in it).
6. Go to source control in VS and commit the change.
7. Still in source control in VS, push the change. It seems to be automatically linked to the source repote repo.
8. Return to GitHub to check that the new file has been added, and the push has been successful.
